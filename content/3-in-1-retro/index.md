The retro 3-in-1 adapter lets you play your favorite games using controllers from older consoles.

Using 3 different sockets you can connect these controllers:

+ Super Nintendo/Super Famicom 
+ Nintendo/Famicom
+ Sega Megadrive/Genesis or Master System

You can plug in 3 controllers at once and even play Mario with a Sega controller, or worse, play Sonic with a Nintendo controller.
